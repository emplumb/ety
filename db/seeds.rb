  etymology2: "",
  uses: "",
  romance_cognates: "N/A",
  notes1: "A late development not present in the earliest stage of Proto-Indo-European. After the Anatolian branch separated, there were two language phylums: Proto-Anatolian and \"Core\" Indo-European (a late stage of spoken Proto-Indo-European). Early Proto-Indo-European, prior to the Anatolian departure, did not have the three-gender system found in Latin (masculine, feminine, and neuter), but had a two-gender system (animate and inanimate). Animate nouns could be declined into four numbers: singular, dual, plural, and collective. For contrast, consider modern Spanish <i>perro</i> (singular), <i>perros</i> (plural), and a collective noun like <i>pan</i> (the grammatical treatment of this noun resembles a singular noun, but is in fact neither singular nor plural). There is no true example of the dual form in modern Spanish, where a suffix indicates there are two of something, however the suffix survives as a fossil in <i>ambos</i> and <i>veinte</i>. In the inanimate gender, nouns were classified as singular, dual, or plural.
<p></p>
In Pre-Proto-Indo-European, a suffix *<i>-h<sub>2</sub></i> was used to form <i>plurale tantum</i> nouns out of collective nouns (e.g., \"waters\" from \"water\"). This was attached to the vowel stem *<i>-e-</i>, *<i>-i-</i>, *<i>-u-</i> and *<i>-0-</i> to form *<i>-eh<sub>2</sub></i>, *<i>-ih<sub>2</sub></i>, *<i>-uh<sub>2</sub></i>, and *<i>-h<sub>2</sub></i>.  The four different endings all to express a single idea of plurality would not last. But now we must discuss the historic Proto-Indo-European method for feminizing words.
<p></p>
In Proto-Indo-European *<i>sor</i> \"woman\" was added as a suffix to animate nouns (preserved in Anatolian but also as a fossil in a smattering of non-Anatolian words, like Spanish <i>sor</i>. Linguists do not precisely agree as to why *<i>-sor</i> as a feminine marker was gradually replaced by the *<i>-(e)h<sub>2</sub></i> collective suffix.<p></p>",

  notes2: "The most recent theories involve the suffix playing an \"individualizing\" role. As a collective/abstract suffix *<i>-(e)h<sub>2</sub></i> referred to a subset of larger mass nouns (returning to the example \"waters\" (collective) versus \"water\" (mass), the \"waters\" is plural but refers to a subset of all \"water\"). Over time, the dependence on *<i>-(e)h<sub>2</sub></i> to refer to a subset of a broader category began to individualize the subject. By the late Proto-Indo-European period *<i>-(e)h<sub>2</sub></i> was heavily used, and stood in contrast to the typical animate ending *<i>-s</i>. *<i>-(e)h<sub>2</sub></i> acquired a new sense of \"the other.\"
<p></p>
In compelling support of this theory, a word that looks to be a relic from the transition period from collective/abstract suffix (as preserved in Anatolian and in some Core Indo-European fossils) to a feminine suffix (the familiar <i>-a</i> in Core Indo-European). The Proto-Indo-European word *<i>h<sub>2</sub>u̯id<sup>h</sup>éu̯eh<sub>2</sub>-</i> \"widow\" (animate in Anatolian and feminine in late Proto-Indo-European), looks built off of <i>*h<sub>2</sub>u̯id<sup>h</sup>éu̯o-</i> \"belonging to the one fatally struck.\" Thus the original sense of a widow would have been \"the one of whom was fatally struck,\" then later \"the bereaved,\" and finally \"the female bereaved.\" See Luraghi (2011), Tichy (1993), and Melchert (2014) for a broader discussion.",
